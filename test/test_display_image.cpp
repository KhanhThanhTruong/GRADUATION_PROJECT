/*
  Example for TFT_eSPI library

  Created by Bodmer 31/12/16

  This example draws all fonts (as used by the Adafruit_GFX library) onto the
  screen. These fonts are called the GFX Free Fonts (GFXFF) in this library.

  The fonts are referenced by a short name, see the Free_Fonts.h file
  attached to this sketch.

  Other True Type fonts could be converted using the utility within the
  "fontconvert" folder inside the library. This converted has also been
  copied from the Adafruit_GFX library. 

  Since these fonts are a recent addition Adafruit do not have a tutorial
  available yet on how to use the fontconvert utility.   Linux users will
  no doubt figure it out!  In the meantime there are 48 font files to use
  in sizes from 9 point to 24 point, and in normal, bold, and italic or
  oblique styles.

  This example sketch uses both the print class and drawString() functions
  to plot text to the screen.

  Make sure LOAD_GFXFF is defined in the User_Setup.h file within the
  library folder.

  --------------------------- NOTE ----------------------------------------
  The free font encoding format does not lend itself easily to plotting
  the background without flicker. For values that changes on screen it is
  better to use Fonts 1- 8 which are encoded specifically for rapid
  drawing with background.

// These lines produce errors during compile time if settings in User_Setup are not correct

// The error will be "does not name a type" but ignore this and read the text between ''

// Either delete all the following lines if you do not want warnings, or change the lines
// to suit your sketch modifications.
